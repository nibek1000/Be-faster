# Be-faster
It was game, made in very few minutes because of boredom. Got very positive feedback about it so decided to publish it. It got very little popularity soe I took it down over time. Now I want to save my old project and maybe make someone have a little fun.<br>
It may give you some basic knowlage about C#, WaitForSeconds() function, Unity UI system and GooglePlay (0.9.x) version.<br>
<h2>Built on Unity 2018.1.6f1</h2>
